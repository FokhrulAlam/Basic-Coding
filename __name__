We will call a module and use the __name__ variable. To simplify it, I am typing the code here:

###The following is our module to be called and its name is "module_called". Copy it and create a new python file. 

def add():
    print("result 1 is ")

def sub():
    print("result 2 is ")

def main():
    add()
    sub()
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
    
### The following is our file where we will call the module_called module.

from youtube_1 import add

def fun1():
    add()
    print("from fun1")

def fun2():
    print("from fun2")
def main():
    fun1()
    fun2()
main()
