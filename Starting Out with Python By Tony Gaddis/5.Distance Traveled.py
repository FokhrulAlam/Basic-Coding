#Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels
#down the iner-state can be calculated with the following formula:
#Distance=Speed*Time

#A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays:
    #The distance traveled in 6 hours
    #The distance traveled in 10 hours
    #The distance traveled in 15 hours

#Please keep in mind I am going to apply my knowledge of string here.
